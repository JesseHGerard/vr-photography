### about this project
While working as Studio Manager for Hoachlander Davis Photography(HDP), it became apparent that there were new and exciting forms of photography that were just on the cusp of viability for photographers to integrate into their everyday practice. With my product design background, it became I thought that I could do a better job of creating an accessible interface for our clients. With the incredible support and encouragement of the HDP principals, I developed new techniques and methods for the studio to capture and present web-based VR photography.
<br><br>
HDP now creates VR experiences for clients like [Tishman Speyer](http://hdphoto.gallery/TishmanSpeyer/DCOffice/), [The National Building Museum](http://hdphoto.gallery/BuildingMuseum/InauguralTour/), [SmithGroupJJR](http://hdphoto.gallery/SmithGroupJJR/DPR/) and [others](http://hdphoto.gallery/Directory/). This type of polished VR experience was so cutting-edge for the VR industry, I was given the chance with HDP to present at the [Nation AIA conference](https://aiau.aia.org/courses/state-art-architectural-photography), and the [District Architecture Center](https://www.aiadc.com/event/lunchtime-learning-virtual-reality-photography-architecture).
<br><br>
It was the success of this program that inspired me to become a full time web developer, in part to create better tools to present new media, user experiences, and interfaces like these. You can [see the tours yourself](http://hdphoto.gallery/Directory/) in any web browser (and with google cardboard on mobile). And, [read the introduction](http://hdphoto.gallery/) for HDP clients. I was also deeply involved in creating HDP's award-winning [architectural still photography](http://hdphoto.com/), and have been published in [DC Architecture Magazine](http://flipbook.hbp.com/summer2017/mobile/index.html#p=54).

### where's the code?
This project is not open-source :(<br>
It was largely made using gui tools as part of a virtual reality production workflow. Why is it on Github then? Because Github is a great place for people (like you) to find and see many of my projects!
